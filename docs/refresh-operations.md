# Refresh operations

Work from a pinned commit and retain the cohort cutoff separately from the date
of an individual source review. Research jobs are not a substantive acceptance gate.

## Due work

Run the ballot worklist without network or model calls:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_ballot_due_work.py --today 2026-11-06 \
  --output work/audit/ballot-due-work-2026-11-06.json
python3 scripts/build_worklist.py --today 2026-11-06 --pretty
```

Ballot rules use exact election days only. The default qualification lead is 30
calendar days; post-election collection starts the following day. These are
operator priorities, not statutory deadlines. Current result observations exclude
explicitly superseded observations. Uncertified current observations require a
certification/correction check. Non-advisory measures require separate implementation
review; no outcome or operative law is inferred. Re-running this report does not
mark a task completed or renew source dates. Resolve tasks through evidence review
and canonical correction/publication, then regenerate from the new snapshot.

The seven unresolved frozen candidates remain in the separate ballot disposition
ledger. The legacy worklist handles expiry, unknown extension anchors, stale pending
records and verification markers. Its date alerts are research prompts: verify the
actual effective-date anchor, calendar term and later actions before changing status.

## Acquisition and interruption

Use a bounded `scripts/research_client.py` directory with persistent caps. Preserve
its ledgers, original bodies/text, failed attempts and separately registered reviewed
derivations. Inspect terminal status and the same process handle after an observation
timeout; do not restart a job merely because output observation expired. Original
November jobs are all terminal and should not be rerun as a collection recovery step.
Raw source copies remain private; public hashes and review excerpts follow the
source-tracking policy. Do not promote a CAPTCHA response or search snippet as a
successful primary acquisition.

## Restore and release preparation

`scripts/build_release_candidate.py` builds public assets from a committed revision.
Its archive includes retained expanded generations and the relative `data/expanded`
pointer. Restore into a new empty directory with a symlink-aware extractor, retain
all generations, and verify every member against the manifest. The candidate is a
data bundle, not a complete source-code/runtime distribution; use the pinned source
checkout and its dependencies to rerun validators against the restored inputs.

A deterministic archive, successful build or local tag does not prove publication.
Verify remote branch/tag targets, GitHub Release metadata, downloaded asset hashes
and hosted-page bytes separately. Historical paper/consumer editions keep their
own cutoffs. No schedules are created by this workflow.
